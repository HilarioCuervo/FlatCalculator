#  FlatCalculator

FlatCalculator is a calculator based on the iOS App 'Calculator', but with a different style and the goal of being easy to use and visually pleasing.


## Design

To create the FlatCalculator, I tried to make an beautiful and easy to use app, so I decided to use flat colors and a custom font to create that feeling.

The color palette was selected from https://colorhunt.co/palettes/dark
The font called 'Play' was selected from https://fonts.google.com
And finally, the logo was created with https://www.canva.com/ , and I used the same colors of the app to improve the combination.


## Usage

The FlatCalculator is a simple Calculator, that support the following basic operations:
    -   Addition
    -   Substraction
    -   Multiplication
    -   Division
    
Additionally, the FlatCalculator support the +/- and the % operations, to even offer more options.

Finally, you just to doble click at the -FlatCalculator.xcodeproj- file, and you can enjoy the FlatCalculator App!
